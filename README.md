This is a project repository for the CERN Challenge Based Innovation course held at Tampere University in Fall 2019. The goal of the project was to find a technological solution to help farmers in rural Africa. The resulting prototype was a low-cost device capable of receiving images sent over radio transmission, or by mobile networks and speakerphone. This repository contains some of the python scripts used for compression, transmission and prototype UI demos.
